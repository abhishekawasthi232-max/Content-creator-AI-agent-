# Content-creator-AI-agent-

This project demonstrates a fully orchestrated AI agent designed to automate the process of creating engaging, professionally styled LinkedIn posts based on real-time industry news

"I woke up to this notification (see below) from my AI Agent about Google‚Äôs Gemini Nano Pro‚Äîand it perfectly illustrates the next major frontier in AI: On-Device Intelligence.

But the real product story isn't the news itself; it's the workflow that delivered this highly relevant, personalized update to my Discord channel while I slept. I designed an Agent to automate my thought leadership.

This agent breaks down the task of content creation into reliable, autonomous steps. Here‚Äôs the architecture and the Product Logic behind each node:"

The Agentic Workflow Breakdown:



üî¥ Webhook (Trigger): The Input Gate. This webhook is connected to a news source. My design decision was to use a simple, universal trigger that can be scaled to any RSS feed or database, making the agent highly versatile.

‚ú® Google Gemini AI (Node 4 - Summarization): The AI Researcher. This node takes the raw news content and summarizes it for a quick understanding. Its job is to sift through the noise and extract the core facts (the Nano Pro speed, privacy, and performance claims).

üõ†Ô∏è Tools (Compose a String): The Content Planner. This step isn't AI, but it's crucial for product quality. I use it to inject the target persona and tone (e.g., "Write a highly enthusiastic, Hindi-infused update for social media"). This ensures the output style is consistent and engaging.

{} JSON (Parse JSON): The Data Validator. This technical step ensures the data is perfectly clean and structured before generating the final copy. This prevents downstream errors and maintains workflow reliability.

‚ú® Google Gemini AI (Node 14 - Content Generation): The Creative Writer. This is where the model uses the structured data to generate the final, dual-language post. This step turns factual information into the polished, shareable asset you see below.

‚ú® Google Gemini AI (Node 15 - Optimization/Hashtags): The Engagement Specialist. This node reviews the draft and adds optimized keywords and hashtags to maximize visibility and reach on LinkedIn. This directly serves the business goal of increasing content performance.

üü¶ Discord (Node 24 - Send a Message): The Human-in-the-Loop Endpoint. The final post is delivered here for my final review and approval. The ultimate PM safety net: automation runs, but the human retains final quality control.

The Live Result (**Bhai, Google ne game badal diya hai! Seriously, ab AI seedha tere phone mein aa raha hai, aur itna powerful, tu soch bhi nahi sakta!** Dekho, Google DeepMind ne announce kiya hai **Gemini Nano Pro**. Ye kya hai? Unka jo powerful Gemini AI model hai na, uska ek super-optimized version, exclusively for your smartphone and edge devices. Cloud se data bhej ne ki jhanjhat khatam! Ab tak kya hota tha? Har chhoti cheez ke liye AI ko cloud pe jaana padta tha, right? Latency, privacy ka issue, aur internet bhi chahiye! But with Nano Pro, AI runs *on your device*.
